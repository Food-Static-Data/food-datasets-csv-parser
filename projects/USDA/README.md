Main task is here: https://github.com/GroceriStar/sd/issues/471

We have a few files, stored at https://github.com/ChickenKyiv/awesome-food-db-strucutures/tree/master/USDA-01-06-2019

- [ ] add tests
- [ ] make it work
- [ ] update structure for data and raw folders
- [ ] shx module can actually be used for calling different parser scripts. Or we can do it in a better way...
- [ ] Replace old rollup with new one
- [ ] Parser Index file for more easy export
- [ ] Get rid of old way to parse stuff. I mean we have a pretty similar logic at each of our parser files. It definitely can be improved and it can be easy to do.
- [ ] JSON should be generated at proper place inside of `data` folder
